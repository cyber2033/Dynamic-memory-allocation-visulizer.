# Dynamic-memory-allocation-visulizer.
Dynamic Memory Allocation Visualizer is a simple and effective learning tool that helps in understanding how memory is allocated at runtime.
It clearly demonstrates dynamic memory behavior using visual blocks, which makes complex concepts easier to grasp.
The project explains allocation logic, non-sequential memory patterns, and fragmentation in an intuitive way.
The user interface is clean and beginner-friendly.
Overall, this project is very useful for students studying Operating Systems and memory management concepts.
